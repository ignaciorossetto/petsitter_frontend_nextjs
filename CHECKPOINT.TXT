FIREBASE IN NEWPETFORM WORKS PERFECT!
*PROABLY I HAVE TO UPDATE USERDATA AFTER ADDING A NEW PET

NOW I HAVE TO DO A COUPLE OF THINGS...


1- FETCH REAL PETS. MAKE SURE BACKROUND COLOR WORKS... MAYBE WITH A SWITCH OR REDUCE OR STATE.
    1-1 DELETE SHOULD WORK
2- CREATE AN OPTION TO UPLOAD A USER PROFILE IMAGE

AFTER THAT I SHOULD START CREATING THE CHAT FRONTEND!
THEN I HAVE TO CREATE SITTER MODEL IN BACKEND AND CREATE

CREATE FIND SITTER FRONTEND (GOOGLE MAPS API FETCHING ALL SITTERS ADDRESSES AND MAKING A LIST OF EVERY SITTER WITH NAME AND CALCULATING DISTANCE, PRICE AND REVIEWS)
